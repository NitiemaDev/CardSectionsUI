### What I Learned  

This challenge was a great learning experience! I got hands-on practice with **Sass**, **CSS Grid**, and **Flexbox** to create responsive layouts. Also, I found the **Sass syntax really cool and intuitive!**  

Check out this snippet from my project:  

```scss
@media screen and (max-width: 40em) {
    header {
        h1, h2 {
            font-size: 1.5em;
        }
    }

    main .container .features {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: normal;
    }
}
```

## Future Improvements  

**Optimizing animations & transitions** for a smoother and more engaging user experience.  

**Enhancing accessibility features** to make the project more inclusive and user-friendly.  

**Improving code structure** for better readability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Useful Resources
